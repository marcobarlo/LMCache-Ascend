"""Ops-only binding surface for ``NpuDeviceOps.ensure_native``.

Mirrors upstream's ``lmcache.cuda_ops`` contract: ops plus
``PageBufferShapeDesc`` only. The compiled ``c_ops`` additionally exports
the format enums and ``is_*`` predicates that upstream keeps on
``lmcache_native`` alone, and ``_patch_ops`` merges torch-fallback
re-exports onto it for names the extension lacks. Binding either through
``bind_native`` would violate the device-ops facade contract or shadow
the class-level NPU overrides, so both are filtered out here.
